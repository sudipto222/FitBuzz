# Problem
Design an API which Return data as Fizz Buzz Pattern: A program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number. More on Fizz Buzz: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz BONUS: Validations on User parameters BONUS: If you can host the API somewhere to check the functionality BONUS: Unit Tests & Integration Tests

# Fitbuzz

Clone or download the github repository
- run npm install to install all dependencies and install node modules 
- run mocha to run both the test and the code
- run node src/fizzbuzz.js to run just the fizzbuzz function
